Most examples in this site use <a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/actions\\\">actions</a> and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/links\\\">links</a>. But it’s easy to use any third party addons distributed via NPM.</p>\\n<p>Here’s how to do it.</p>\\n<p>We are going to use an addon called <a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/notes\\\">Notes</a>. Basically, it allows you to write notes for your stories.</p>\\n<p>First, we need to install the addons:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">npm i --save-dev @storybook/addons @storybook/addon-actions @storybook/addon-links @storybook/addon-notes\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Then, we need to create a file called <code>addons.js</code> inside the storybook config directory and add the following content:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">import '@storybook/addon-actions/register';\\nimport '@storybook/addon-links/register';\\nimport '@storybook/addon-notes/register';\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This will register all the addons and you’ll be able to see the actions and notes panels (in that order) when you are viewing the story. (Links do not register a tab—check individual addon docs to see which Storybook features they use!)</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/stories-without-notes-d23cb039b46a463fc53ee2183d9d7d99-0c959.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 690px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 60.149130074565036%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAMCAYAAABiDJ37AAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAA90lEQVQoz83TzUrDQBAH8BwKgk9QlEJ9CY/6QHmCPaWvknPpJYfkID34DF7UhphdcJvdDSSu+U7IuFloUApijQcHfoeBmT+zhzU2683548M9YhFD9JUi/II1wQVKk1Tb0z0ihIw9Z3ycGwx7JCRoe7edGytrtRRCQBRFWhzHIBMGbyyAXL5DURTH8mN5loPjODeGZVlXw1DTNFpd19B1HfymPM+71YGUUpBSjhdMDkyTBDjnkGUZlGU5PXAI+ez/B1ZV9UXbtj/y7YV935/Mdd2/fbIONE1zEQTBk+/7u4MwDHcY45Oon/Rs2/a1oWqmXCiLiS6Vsw/pTyOXJtwxnQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Stories without notes\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/stories-without-notes-d23cb039b46a463fc53ee2183d9d7d99-44d6a.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/stories-without-notes-d23cb039b46a463fc53ee2183d9d7d99-f4799.png 173w,\\n/static/stories-without-notes-d23cb039b46a463fc53ee2183d9d7d99-b3b1d.png 345w,\\n/static/stories-without-notes-d23cb039b46a463fc53ee2183d9d7d99-44d6a.png 690w,\\n/static/stories-without-notes-d23cb039b46a463fc53ee2183d9d7d99-bc0f7.png 1035w,\\n/static/stories-without-notes-d23cb039b46a463fc53ee2183d9d7d99-b50e5.png 1380w,\\n/static/stories-without-notes-d23cb039b46a463fc53ee2183d9d7d99-0ed32.png 2070w,\\n/static/stories-without-notes-d23cb039b46a463fc53ee2183d9d7d99-0c959.png 2414w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>Now when you are writing a story it like this and add some notes:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">import { storiesOf } from '@storybook/react';\\nimport { action } from '@storybook/addon-actions';\\nimport { WithNotes } from '@storybook/addon-notes';\\n\\nimport Button from './Button';\\n\\nstoriesOf('Button', module)\\n  .add('with some emoji', () => (\\n    &#x3C;WithNotes notes={'Here we use some emoji as the Button text.

Native Addons</h2>\\n<p>Native addons use Storybook as a platform and interact with it. Native addons can add extra features beyond wrapping stories.</p>\\n<p>For example, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/actions\\\">storybook-actions</a> is such an addon.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/addon-actions-demo-a781fbc5c0df101d65d2f0a6c14c04b4.gif\\\" alt=\\\"Demo of Storybook Addon Actions\\\"></p>\\n<p>It will allow you to inspect the parameters of any event

For example, <a href=\\\"https://gist.github.com/metasean/cadd2becd60cc3b295bf49895a56f9b4\\\">this gist</a> sets both next.js and storybook up with global stylesheets.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"why-is-there-no-addons-channel\\\"><a href=\\\"#why-is-there-no-addons-channel\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Why is there no addons channel?</h3>\\n<p>A common error is that an addon tries to access the “channel”, but the channel is not set. This can happen in a few different cases:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>In storybook/addon development, it can be an NPM version problem. If there are two versions of the <code>@storybook/addons</code> NPM package, it will cause problems. In this case, make sure there is only a single version of <code>@storybook/addons</code> being used by your project.</li>\\n<li>In React Native, it’s a special case that’s documented in <a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/issues/1192\\\">#1192</a></li>\\n</ol>\\n<h3 id=\\\"can-i-modify-react-component-state-in-stories\\\"><a href=\\\"#can-i-modify-react-component-state-in-stories\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Can I modify React component state in stories?</h3>\\n<p>Not directly.

Usually the Preview Area is an iframe.</p>\\n<p>When you select a story from the Manager App, the relevant story is rendered inside the Preview Area.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/storybook-components-79d324030bccb3aea4dfc6c7e3ee5a00-43677.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 690px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 62.913907284768214%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Storybook Components\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/storybook-components-79d324030bccb3aea4dfc6c7e3ee5a00-44d6a.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/storybook-components-79d324030bccb3aea4dfc6c7e3ee5a00-f4799.png 173w,\\n/static/storybook-components-79d324030bccb3aea4dfc6c7e3ee5a00-b3b1d.png 345w,\\n/static/storybook-components-79d324030bccb3aea4dfc6c7e3ee5a00-44d6a.png 690w,\\n/static/storybook-components-79d324030bccb3aea4dfc6c7e3ee5a00-bc0f7.png 1035w,\\n/static/storybook-components-79d324030bccb3aea4dfc6c7e3ee5a00-43677.png 1359w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>As shown in the above image, there’s a communication channel that the Manager App and Preview Area use to communicate with each other.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"capabilities\\\"><a href=\\\"#capabilities\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Capabilities</h2>\\n<p>With an addon, you can add more functionality to Storybook.

Then you will want to load them at once. Simply edit your config directory at <code>.storybook/config.js</code> as follows:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">import { configure } from '@storybook/react';\\n\\nconst req = require.context('../src/components', true, /\\\\.stories\\\\.js$/)\\n\\nfunction loadStories() {\\n  req.keys().forEach((filename) => req(filename))\\n}\\n\\nconfigure(loadStories, module);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Here we use Webpack’s <a href=\\\"https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#require-context\\\">require.context</a> to load modules dynamically. Have a look at the relevant Webpack <a href=\\\"https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#require-context\\\">docs</a> to learn more about how to use require.context.</p>\\n<p>The <strong>React Native</strong> packager resolves all the imports at build-time, so it’s not possible to load modules dynamically. If you don’t want to import all your stories manually you can use <a href=\\\"https://github.com/elderfo/react-native-storybook-loader\\\">react-native-storybook-loader</a> to automatically create the import statements for all of your stories. </p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"using-decorators\\\"><a href=\\\"#using-decorators\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Using Decorators</h2>\\n<p>A decorator is a way to wrap a story with a common set of component(s).

(In this example, we add it just for the <strong>MyComponent</strong> story group.)</p>\\n<p>But, you can also add a decorator <strong>globally</strong> and it’ll be applied to all the stories you create.

This is how to do it.\\nSimply add the following content to a file called <code>webpack.config.js</code> in your Storybook config directory (<code>.storybook</code> by default ).</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">const path = require('path');\\n\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  module: {\\n    rules: [\\n      {\\n        test: /\\\\.scss$/,\\n        loaders: [\\\"style-loader\\\", \\\"css-loader\\\", \\\"sass-loader\\\"],\\n        include: path.resolve(__dirname, '../')\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Since this config file stays in the Storybook directory, you need to set the include path as above.

It might be a theme color, some client secret, or a JSON string. So, we usually tend to hard code them.</p>\\n<p>But you can expose those configurations via “environment variables.” For that, you need to prefix your environment variables with <code>STORYBOOK_</code> prefix.</p>\\n<p>For an example, let’s expose two environment variables like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">STORYBOOK_THEME=red STORYBOOK_DATA_KEY=12345 npm run storybook\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Then we can access these environment variables anywhere inside our JS code like below:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">const out = console;\\n\\nout.log(process.env.STORYBOOK_THEME);\\nout.log(process.env.STORYBOOK_DATA_KEY);\\n</code></pre>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Even though we can access these env variables anywhere in the client side JS code, it’s better to use them only inside stories and inside the main Storybook config file.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2 id=\\\"build-time-environment-variables\\\"><a href=\\\"#build-time-environment-variables\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Build time environment variables</h2>\\n<p>You can also pass these environment variables when you are <a href=\\\"/basics/exporting-storybook\\\">building your storybook</a> with <code>build-storybook</code>.</p>\\n<p>Then they’ll be hard coded to the static version of your Storybook.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"node_env-env-variable\\\"><a href=\\\"#node_env-env-variable\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>NODE_ENV env variable</h2>\\n<p>In addition to the above prefixed environment variables, you can also pass the NODE_ENV variable to Storybook.

Manual Testing</h3>\\n<p>All the above sections are about testing with automated tools.\\nBut since we are building UI for humans, we must also manually test them to see how they feel.</p>\\n<p>Another reason for manual testing is for the better user experience.</p>\\n<p>We should always try to test our UI with the naked eye.\\nFor this, we can simply use our existing Storybook.\\nThis is something that we can’t automate(yet) and takes time.\\nBut it would be great if we could do this once in a while (especially with a major code changes).</p>\\n<h2

href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/storyshots\\\">StoryShots</a> is our integration between Storybook and Jest Snapshot Testing.\\nIt’s pretty simple to use.</p>\\n<p>First, make sure you are inside a Storybook-enabled repo (make sure it has few stories).\\nThen, install StoryShots into your app with:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">npm i -D @storybook/addon-storyshots\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Then, assuming you are using Jest for testing, you can create a test file <code>storyshots.test.js</code> that contains the following:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">import initStoryshots from '@storybook/addon-storyshots';\\n\\ninitStoryshots({ /* configuration options */ });\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now you can snapshot test all of your stories with:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">npm test\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This will save the initial set of snapshots inside your Storybook config directory.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/storyshots-first-run-d1ac58bda088901d670988e0dd8fb1e7-44d6a.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n
